### Notes

This matrix will be updated after each port. Initial grouping implementation will be minimal (full reset strategy) and marked Partial until incremental change-emission & property-based regroup features are added. Tests added will move the Tests column to Passing. FollowUp column must be cleared or updated upon completion.
